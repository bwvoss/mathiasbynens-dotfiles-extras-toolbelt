## These are my .extra(s) that get run on install of [Mathias's dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles#add-custom-commands-without-creating-a-new-fork)

* Make sure you change the Git credenitals so you don't commit under my name! *

### Usage
Just source it.  If you're going for it before Mathias's dotfiles run, copy it into your root and the .extra file will be sourced automatically by his bootstrap.sh.


### Updates
I'll be updating it whenever I find the need, and even though it's a little different than a normal OS lib, I'll still maintain a changelog and semantic versioning using git tags.
